Customer Retention: Retention rate, churn rate, repeat purchase rate.

Profitability: Gross margin, revenue per customer.

Seasonality Trends: Sales fluctuations over different time periods.

Report Structure

Executive Summary – A high-level summary of key findings.

Business Requirements – The company's objectives, such as improving sales and retaining more customers.

Data Sources – Sales transactions, customer demographics, and purchase history.

Findings & Insights – Key patterns, including seasonality, top-selling products, and high-risk churn segments.

2. Data Analysis & Insights Generation

Dataset Information

The dataset consists of:

Transaction Data: Order ID, product name, category, sales amount, purchase date.

Customer Data: Customer ID, purchase history, churn status, demographic details.
